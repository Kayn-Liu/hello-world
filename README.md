# hello-world
This is my very first repository at Git-hub
I am new to programming and are currently learning C# and Unity3D engine. I will be start working on my own project and will start looking for a job as soon as it is ready. I hope that after a month or two when I look back at this, I am at least doing somewhat better than where I am at right now. Good luck to me!
